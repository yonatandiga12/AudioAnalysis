At this hour, there are IDF forces and senior IDF command in each of the settlements in the Gaza envelope. There are 22 combat management centers in the envelope. There are 35 battalions and special forces located throughout the Southern Command sector, with emphasis on the Gaza envelope. We are managing the fighting against the terrorists. There are tough battles. Commanders and soldiers are fighting terrorists. Settlements have already been described, but we continue to search and will update. We will update each settlement and the residents when we know that the fighting in the settlement has ended.
All security forces are carrying out roadblocks together with the police in all areas in the Gaza envelope and outside the envelope in the areas of the Southern Command. The Gaza Division and Southern Command are managing the fighting with extensive support and strikes by the Air Force in every place where there are Hamas personnel. There will be no safe point for them. Hamas and Islamic Jihad - all the terrorists who entered the territory of the State of Israel will be killed, whether in battles or in their retreat.
All terrorists in Gaza who belong to Hamas, everyone who belongs to Hamas or Islamic Jihad, their blood is on their own heads. Difficult hours are ahead of us, hours of fighting. There are civilians who have been murdered. There are commanders and soldiers who have been killed in battles. There are also hostages and prisoners of war that Hamas has taken captive - soldiers and civilians. We will provide accurate data later. We need to show responsibility.
Citizens of the State of Israel, the media - there is a lot of fake news on social networks. The IDF spokesperson will continue to update you continuously and provide the true picture as it is, even if it is difficult. Currently, there is heavy fighting in the Gaza envelope. There is also uncertainty. We will create a clear situation picture and convey it to the public.
Residents of the south, especially those in the Gaza envelope, are currently in their homes. Near some of them, terrorists are moving. All possible IDF forces, especially special forces, are in these settlements and fighting. The residents of the south, the residents of the envelope, are showing tremendous resilience, and thanks to this resilience, we are managing the fighting and we will win these battles.
In every place in the envelope, the terrorists who entered will be killed. The rest of the citizens of the State of Israel up to 80 kilometers from the envelope are in a special situation on the home front. They must stay near protected spaces and listen to the Home Front Command's instructions. I assume we will see more Hamas tensions, especially in the coming hours, and we need to stay near protected spaces and listen to the Home Front Command's instructions.
The IDF has begun a wide reserve mobilization. We will mobilize as needed up to hundreds of thousands for any situation. As I said, we are at war. We are alert in all sectors, including the Northern Command. In each of the sectors, the forces have been reinforced and we are on full alert. Anyone who attacks us from the northern arena or from another area will pay a very heavy price.
Our focus now, as I said, is on the Gaza envelope, on the infiltration of terrorists into the settlements. The IDF is fighting in all settlements. We will reach the end of this fighting in the coming hours to restore a security situation within the settlements, and we will update settlement by settlement on the completion of searches and the description and killing of terrorists.
We are at war. This is a situation we haven't known for many years. This is not an operation, it's a war. National responsibility is required. It is necessary to obey the security forces, to obey the Home Front Command's instructions, not to listen to fake news on various channels, to listen to the IDF spokesperson's announcements, to the orderly announcements in the media.
We need this resilience of the public in order to manage the fighting. As the IDF has proven in the past that it knows how to deal with any war and win it decisively, so it will be this time.
