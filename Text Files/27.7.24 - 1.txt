This evening, in a severe and tragic disaster, ten Israeli children were killed and around 20 were injured as a result of a rocket fired by the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which struck a soccer field in the center of Majdal Shams. All the victims were children between the ages of 10 and 20. We extend our condolences to the families of the victims and embrace the entire Druze community in this difficult time. We send strength to the wounded and wish them a speedy recovery.

From an initial investigation of the incident, a warning was activated, but it was a very short, immediate alert. The Air Force's preliminary investigation suggests that it was a single rocket. We are currently conducting a thorough investigation and will release details transparently to the public. We are in contact with local authorities in Majdal Shams, as we have been throughout the past months, and have been supporting them in the past few hours.

The Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff are holding several situation assessments with the participation of the Head of the Shin Bet, the Head of Mossad, and members of the General Staff Forum, and these assessments are ongoing. At this time, there is no change in the Home Front Command's instructions. If there are changes, we will update via communication channels and the official channels of the IDF and the Home Front Command.

In the last hour, Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the incident, but our intelligence is clear: Hezbollah is responsible for the killing of innocent children, children as young as 10 years old. Once again, the cruelty of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization has been exposed. This is a very serious incident, and we will act accordingly. The IDF will do everything necessary to protect the citizens of Israel.
