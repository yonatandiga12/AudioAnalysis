This morning, with broken hearts, we stand with the families of Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Almog Serussi, Hirsch Goldberg Polin, Carmel Gat, and Eden Yerushalmi, of blessed memory. A few hours ago, the families were informed that the bodies of their loved ones were found by an IDF force in an underground tunnel in Rafah. According to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them. They were kidnapped alive on the morning of October 7 by Hamas. Their bodies were discovered during the fighting in Rafah, in an underground tunnel, about a kilometer from the tunnel where we rescued Farhan Kadi a few days ago.

Since Farhan's discovery, our forces have been instructed to act with even more caution and precision, understanding that there may be other hostages in the area. We did not have precise information about the hostages' exact location. There was ongoing fighting above ground, and the forces eliminated terrorists during the battles yesterday. The forces are still operating in the area at this moment.

Last night, IDF forces located and recovered the bodies from the tunnel, bringing them to Israel for further identification. This process, conducted by medical personnel and the 443 Unit of the Israel Police, has been completed. IDF representatives delivered the news to the families. We share in the immense pain of the families during this difficult time. Words cannot describe the unimaginable suffering of the hostages in Hamas captivity since October 7, now 331 days, and the pain their families endure. This news shakes all of us this morning.
