The IDF has declared a state of war. We have been in a state of war since 6:30 this morning. Hamas has fired over 2,000 rockets toward Israeli territory. Terrorists have infiltrated Israeli territory and are still present. We are currently engaged in combat, with multiple hotspots in the south where terrorists are located. The IDF is flooding the south and the border communities with numerous operational forces. Additionally, operational commanders are arriving to manage the fighting at all hotspots. We are currently focusing on combat in the Gaza border communities. Simultaneously, we have launched a large-scale reserve call-up across all IDF units. The Air Force and other forces have initiated a wide-scale attack on the city of Gaza in recent hours.

There are many false reports and numerous videos circulating. I ask the public and the media to act responsibly and rely on the IDF spokesperson and our official reports. We will keep the public updated in real-time. We are in a state of war, deploying operational forces in the south, fighting at hotspots, and will continue to provide you with the full picture of the situation.
