We are on the 13th day of the war in Gaza. In the past 24 hours, we have destroyed and attacked numerous terror infrastructures, with a focus on the Sajaiya neighborhood, and we have continued to eliminate Nukhba terrorists. According to intelligence from the Shin Bet, we have also eliminated a senior member of the Popular Resistance Committees, which is one of the main terror organizations in the Gaza Strip. IDF forces also carried out raids along the front line over the past day. The purpose of these raids is to improve our situation in the attack zones and to continue gathering information on the issue of missing persons and hostages.

I want to emphasize to the public that the task of clearing the area is not over. We still regard the Gaza border region as a combat zone. We are searching and checking. Yesterday, we captured an exhausted terrorist on his way to Gaza; he was arrested and is now being interrogated by our forces. We must finish scanning this area and ensure that there are no terrorists left.

In the north, overnight, the Air Force continued extensive attacks on military positions of the Hezbollah terrorist organization. The logic behind the strikes is to target Hezbollah’s reconnaissance and observation systems along the border and attack them in response to any strikes or fire directed at Israel. Any attack by Hezbollah on Israeli territory will be met with a significant response from us. We remain strongly deployed and alert in the Northern Command.

We continue our main effort to ensure the full operational readiness of our forces for the next stages of the war. This involves not only training and preparing forces and operational plans but also a logistical effort to supply equipment and improve protective gear and personal equipment for forces on the ground. This will be done in a prioritized order, with the forces entering combat first receiving the full range of equipment.

I encourage IDF personnel and the public, including parents of active-duty soldiers and reservists, to continue contacting the Technology and Logistics Branch hotline on WhatsApp at 052-615-6256. The hotline is available around the clock. Today, the Ground Forces Commander and the Technology and Logistics Commander will provide briefings and explanations and will continue gathering information and analyzing their systems to ensure we have the best equipment in the field.

For example, in the last 24 hours, we have delivered more than 50,000 raincoats, over 100,000 heating packs, and more than 10,000 winter coats to forces on the ground, understanding that we are entering colder weather and the fighting is expected to be long. So far, we have informed the families of 306 fallen soldiers and the families of 203 hostages. We share in the families' pain and embrace them in their difficult hour.

I want to address the number of hostages and emphasize the importance of this issue, which is a top national priority. We must convey to the families all the information we have, whether it has high, medium, or low certainty. Every family knows the level of certainty we have. Of the 203 hostages, some are in the "high certainty" category, and the families know this; some are in the "medium" and "low" certainty categories, and some have already been ruled out. We will continue providing the public with the latest numbers, and after we speak with the families, we will update them. This process is ongoing around the clock, with the help of two special headquarters led by Major General (res.) Lior Carmeli and another operational headquarters led by Major General (res.) Nitzan Alon, which are responsible for intelligence and operational opportunities regarding the hostages.

As for the home front, I call on the citizens of Israel to continue following the Home Front Command's instructions, as they have done throughout this war. Check for updates on the changes to the Home Front Command's guidelines, follow what we are updating, and act responsibly. Adhering to the instructions saves lives, prevents casualties, and allows us to continue the war. The guidelines are available at the 104 hotline and online. Keep checking and staying updated.
