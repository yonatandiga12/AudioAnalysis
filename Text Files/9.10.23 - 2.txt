Good evening, we are currently in the offensive stage. The goal set for the IDF is that after this, every entity in Gaza will understand the heavy price of war with the State of Israel. This won't be expressed in words but in actions that the IDF will carry out in the coming hours and days, for as long as necessary.

In the last 24 hours, we have been conducting intense airstrikes, a deadly aerial operation involving thousands of munitions. To give perspective, the rate of strikes is five times higher than what was carried out on Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War.

I'm repeating, the rate of strikes is five times higher. Right now, 60 fighter jets have just completed a strike in the heart of Gaza City, in multiple rounds on the Rimal neighborhood, densely populated, where we have intelligence on terrorists. This means gathering areas for terrorists, operational apartments, and terrorist command centers. Yesterday, we carried out a similar strike in the Beit Hanoun neighborhood, and we know that we killed dozens of terrorists.

So far, there are hundreds of terrorists killed inside Gaza, hundreds we've killed near the border fence, and many are still active in the area near the Gaza perimeter, alongside dozens of hostages held by us. We are in control of the perimeter area; most of the fence-adjacent settlements have already been evacuated. In fact, we've completed the evacuation of these areas, except for a few families who chose to stay, and we respect that decision.

This afternoon, I accompanied the Chief of Staff to the Gaza Division. The Chief of Staff was with the commanders, walking through the area, house by house, as the soldiers are going through every point, searching for terrorists, including suicide bombers who are waiting to attack us.

No terrorists are currently crossing the border. We are prepared throughout the entire border area with tanks and planes, ready to kill any terrorists. The current mission in the perimeter is to clear the area, as our soldiers are encountering small groups of terrorists. This has happened a few times, but in the last few hours, we haven't had any encounters.

In the northern front, there were some incidents a few hours ago. There was one infiltration in the area of Metula, involving four terrorists, of which we killed three, and one escaped toward Lebanon. We are still determining their identity. Beyond that, we attacked Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

In terms of the war front, we are closely monitoring all fronts with high readiness. Whoever attacks us will pay a very heavy price. We have mobilized over 300,000 reservists within 48 hours, which is an extremely rapid rate of mobilization, faster than in any previous event.

Regarding reports of equipment shortages in the media and social networks—reports of lack of food, vests, and equipment—I want to clarify: there is no shortage of equipment in the IDF. Every soldier currently carrying out missions in Gaza has the necessary equipment, and those who are about to go in will also receive all the required equipment.

The public sending food and gathering supplies warms our hearts and boosts morale, and it's very important that the reservists and the IDF feel the public's support. But I want to reassure you that the IDF has all the necessary combat equipment, and it will reach everyone. Patience is needed.

We've also set up a civilian task force, led by Major General Lior Carmeli, to handle the captives and the missing. At this stage, we are visiting families personally, through very senior officers, talking to them, taking DNA samples, and sharing with them all the details we have. We have full details on all the captives currently in Gaza.

So far, we've updated 30 families, and after all the families are informed, we will update the public on the exact number of captives in Gaza. Alongside this, a special intelligence team has been established to begin piecing together intelligence on where the captives are in Gaza, and we will reach them.

We know these are difficult days for everyone. We have lost many citizens and soldiers. Over 700 civilians and soldiers have been killed. We've informed 85 families that their loved ones are IDF casualties, and we embrace these families. There are hundreds of wounded, and we wish them a full recovery.

The feelings are very difficult, and there is frustration, but at the end of the day, we must remember one thing: we will win. We've paid a heavy price, and we will exact an unbearable price in return. The IDF soldiers acted with supreme courage and will continue to fight bravely for as long as needed. We've only just begun. Our intention is to hold every terrorist accountable who harmed Israeli citizens.

We have no time limits, no territorial limits, and no capability limits. We have one compass: security and victory.
