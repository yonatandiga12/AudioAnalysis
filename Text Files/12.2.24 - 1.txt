Last night, we brought Luis and Fernando home in a joint rescue operation by the IDF, the Shin Bet, and Yamam, the special unit of the Israeli Police. We rescued Luis Herr and Fernando Merman, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 from Nir Yitzhak. It was a complex rescue operation under fire in the heart of Rafah, based on sensitive and high-quality intelligence from the Intelligence Division and the Shin Bet.

The Shin Bet's operational unit, Yamam, along with forces from Division 98, Shayetet 13, and Brigade 7, performed a professional and precise action. There was an aerial envelope of airstrikes by the Air Force in coordination with the Southern Command. This operation had been in preparation for some time, and we waited for the right conditions to execute it.

In the early morning hours at 1:09, the special forces broke into the building in the heart of Rafah, where Luis and Fernando were being held on the second floor by armed Hamas terrorists. There were also terrorists in the neighboring buildings. From the moment they broke in, Yamam fighters shielded Luis and Fernando with their bodies during a fierce firefight with many terrorists in several locations.

At 1:50, an aerial envelope managed by the Air Force and Southern Command began operating to allow the force to break contact and neutralize Hamas terrorists in the area. At that point, the fighters extracted Luis and Fernando from the apartment, rescuing them under fire, accompanied by IDF forces providing protection until they reached a safe area. There, they underwent an initial medical examination by the forces on the ground and were evacuated by helicopter with Unit 669 for further medical treatment at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, where they were reunited with their families in great excitement.

The Chief of Staff, the Head of the Shin Bet, and the Police Commissioner were in the Shin Bet's command center, where they monitored and led the operation. The Prime Minister and Defense Minister also arrived at the command center during the night to oversee the operation. It was a very intense and emotional night.

This operation was made possible by the immense sacrifice of the regular and reserve soldiers throughout the war, particularly those who fell or were wounded in the battles. Without their efforts and sacrifice, we would not have reached this moment.

Despite the excitement this morning following the successful rescue operation, we do not forget that 134 hostages are still held in Gaza. I want to address the hostages: If you are hearing me this morning, know that we are very determined to bring you home, and we will not miss any opportunity to do so. Yesterday, I visited the Yaakov family from Nir Oz, whose father, Yair, is still held captive. His daughter, Shir, told me that since October 7, their lives have become one continuous day of endless sunrises and sunsets. Her words left a mark on me. For 134 families, the sun has not yet risen. This morning, two families saw the sun rise for a new day. We will continue to do everything in our power to bring all the hostages home.
