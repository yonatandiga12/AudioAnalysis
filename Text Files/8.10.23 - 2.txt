We are at the Southern Command following a situation assessment held here by the Chief of Staff, alongside the Commander of the Southern Command. In recent hours, our fighters have been operating in the Gaza envelope area to protect the residents and clear the area of terrorists. There were exchanges of fire involving the Paratroopers Brigade and special units in the town of Be'eri, encounters with terrorists in Kfar Aza with forces from Shayetet 13, Shaldag, Duvdevan, Yahalom, and the Givati Brigade. The Navy also thwarted a terrorist cell off the coast of Zikim, and there is ongoing fighting in Nahal Oz, Kissufim, and other areas. Our forces are actively engaging the enemy and striving to reach every place where terrorists are present and eliminate them. Some terrorists tried to flee back into Gaza but were killed at the border fence, and we will continue to target anyone approaching Israeli territory.

In the past few hours, the Chief of Staff conducted a situation assessment here at the Southern Command with the Gaza Division Commander. The commanders are stable, strong, and operating professionally under intense fighting. We are reinforcing our forces, securing the area, with an emphasis on the Gaza envelope, clearing the area, and striking terrorists wherever they are. In our attack on Gaza, we have destroyed around 800 targets using fighter jets, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Today, at 3:45 PM, the IDF conducted a massive strike in the Beit Hanoun neighborhood. The attack occurred in three waves, involving over 50 fighter jets, which dropped dozens of tons of munitions on 120 targets in the neighborhood. This was a complex air operation that resulted in the destruction of all the buildings in Beit Hanoun, which had served as a staging ground for attacks by Hamas's Nuhba forces against Israel. The IDF will continue to strike such areas with this level of intensity, targeting all staging and attack zones used by Hamas and its fighters.

The Air Force is functioning fully, conducting widespread operations, and ready for further strikes, bolstered by thousands of reservists who have joined its ranks. Hamas has brought disaster upon the residents of Gaza in response to our attacks, with hundreds of their fighters killed and thousands wounded, some of whom are still on Israeli territory. Since the fighting began, dozens of enemy terrorists have been taken captive, including in the past few hours.

In the Northern Command, there were several incidents of rocket fire on IDF positions without causing casualties. Our forces responded with fire at Hezbollah positions and infrastructure responsible for the attacks. We are closely monitoring Hezbollah’s actions and all enemies in the northern theater, and we remain prepared across the entire war zone. I urge the public to follow Home Front Command's instructions and to reach out for any information they need.

Once again, I emphasize the available hotlines: the IDF Personnel Directorate's hotline for missing soldiers at 1111 (extension 5, then 4), and the Home Front Command hotline at 104, as well as the joint Home Front Command and Israel Police family center at Ben Gurion Airport, reachable through the 105 hotline. I ask the public not to spread rumors online. We notify the families of soldiers and civilians first before releasing any information to the public about missing persons and the deceased.

There is room for tough questions and thorough investigations. The Israeli public deserves answers, and it is our responsibility to provide them. However, at this moment, we are in the midst of war. The IDF is fully engaged in using its power to strike and defeat the enemy. First, we will fight, and afterward, we will investigate. We are witnessing extraordinary civilian bravery in recent days. Men, women, and children are showing composure and courage in the face of a murderous terrorist organization.

The resilience displayed by the residents of the south serves as an example to all of us. The IDF continues to fight with all its might. The commander of the Multidimensional Unit, Colonel Roi Levy, of blessed memory, was killed during an encounter with terrorists who had entrenched themselves in Kibbutz Re'im. During the encounter, Roi and his soldiers killed ten terrorists. This has been the case with other commanders and soldiers who have fallen in battle. Every fallen commander has been immediately replaced by new commanders who have stepped up to continue the fight.

These are the IDF's commanders and soldiers — determined to protect the citizens of Israel, always at the front lines, and they are the ones who will secure victory.
