Good morning,

Last night, Iran launched an attack against Israel, firing over 300 various threats. The Iranian threat was met with the superior air and technological capabilities of the IDF, combined with a strong fighting coalition that together intercepted the vast majority of these threats. We intercepted 99% of the threats launched toward Israel. This is a significant strategic achievement.

Out of approximately 170 unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Iran, none penetrated Israeli territory, and dozens were intercepted by Air Force fighter jets, our air defense system, and the systems of our allies. Of more than 30 cruise missiles launched by Iran, none penetrated Israeli territory; 25 of them were intercepted by Air Force fighter jets outside our borders. Out of more than 120 ballistic missiles, a few penetrated Israeli territory, and the rest were intercepted. The missiles that did hit landed at the Nevatim Air Force Base, causing only minor infrastructure damage. As you can see, the base remains operational and continues to carry out its missions.

In the image, you can see the runway at the Nevatim base. Iran thought it could cripple the base and thus damage our air capabilities, but it failed. Air Force planes continue to take off and land at the base, carrying out missions for both offense and defense, including the F-35s, which are returning from a defense mission at the base and will soon land.

In addition to the launches from Iran, there were several launches from Iraq and Yemen, none of which penetrated Israel. In the last few hours, dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon toward the north; there were no casualties. Air Force planes struck Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including Radwan targets, while numerous other aircraft continued defense missions.

For the past six months, we have been working in close coordination with our partners, primarily the United States Central Command, the UK, France, and other countries, who were involved in last night’s operations. This partnership has always been strong, but last night it was demonstrated in an exceptional manner. We conducted a highly complex air defense operation with excellent execution by the Air Force and the Intelligence Division under the leadership of the Chief of Staff from the Air Force command center.

The alert capabilities of our air defense systems and the defense capabilities of Air Force jets proved extraordinary professionalism and military and technological superiority. Thanks to all these factors, the Iranian attack as planned was thwarted. Unfortunately, a 10-year-old girl was severely injured by shrapnel. We wish her a speedy recovery. Aside from her, as far as we know, there are no other casualties.

However, it’s important to note that the event is not over. We remain prepared for further developments and additional threats. The Home Front Command’s guidelines remain in place, including restrictions on education, overnight stays in campsites, and trips. If there are changes to the guidelines, we will update you immediately with transparency and responsibility, just as we did last night.

The exemplary behavior on the home front throughout the night is commendable, and it is now necessary to continue acting responsibly and calmly without panic. We will do everything we can to ensure that the public receives timely and relevant information.

Throughout the night, we conducted situational assessments in the IDF in response to the developments. The Chief of Staff reviewed plans for the future, which were presented to the political leadership. Iran took a very serious action last night, pushing the Middle East toward escalation. We will do and are doing everything necessary to protect the citizens of Israel.

Alongside last night’s developments, we have not forgotten for a moment the 133 hostages still held in Gaza. We will continue doing everything we can to bring them home as quickly as possible.
