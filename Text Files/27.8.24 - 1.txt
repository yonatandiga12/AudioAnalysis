Good afternoon,

A few hours ago, in a special, brave, and complex rescue operation, IDF and Shin-Bet forces rescued the hostage Farhan al-Qadi, 52, a resident of Rahat and a father of 11 children. About an hour ago, Farhan arrived at Soroka Hospital in stable condition, where he met his family. On the morning of October 7, he was kidnapped near Miftahim.

This morning, commandos from Shayetet 13, the Yahalom Unit, and the Shin-Bet rescued Farhan alive from an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip in a complex and brave operation led by Division 162, with the support of the Nahal Brigade and the 401st Brigade. The soldiers reached the location thanks to precise intelligence gathered by the Intelligence Directorate, the Shin-Bet, and the Hostage Headquarters. We are committed to the noble mission of returning all the hostages, using every effort.

While we rejoice in Farhan's return, and every hostage is a world in themselves, 108 hostages are still being held in Gaza. We are working to bring them all home. The forces continue to fight resolutely in the field, and there are additional details I cannot share at this stage. It will take time, and you must act responsibly and cautiously, especially on social media, by not spreading information about the operation. This is for the safety of our hostages, our forces, and the security of the state.
