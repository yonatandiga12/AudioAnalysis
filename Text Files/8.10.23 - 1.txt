We are on the second day of the war against the terrorist organizations Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. IDF forces have been operating throughout the night to secure the area, kill terrorists, and take control of all combat zones. The IDF has demonstrated control over the infiltration points from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, with the forces killing hundreds of terrorists in the field. There is ongoing combat and rescue operations for hostages, which took place throughout the night and are continuing now.

During the fighting, commanders and soldiers have fallen in battle, and civilians have been murdered. Hundreds of terrorists have been killed, and dozens have been taken captive. As of now, there are IDF forces fighting in Kfar Aza, and searches are ongoing in many communities. The IDF is present in every settlement with special forces, infantry units, and brigades. No community is without IDF forces. We are evacuating residents, and our mission in the coming day is to ensure the safe evacuation of all the Gaza envelope residents. This evacuation must be secure, with thorough searches to ensure no terrorists remain. Buses will be used to evacuate the residents, and we aim to complete this mission within the next day.

There are tens of thousands of soldiers in the entire Gaza envelope area. We will continue and reach every settlement until all terrorists within Israeli territory are eliminated. The IDF's attack on Gaza has been strong. So far, we have attacked about 500 targets, including all of Hamas's operational infrastructures, and the strikes are ongoing. Every Hamas leader’s home is being targeted, and we continue to strike symbols of Hamas's control. Towers used by the organization are also being hit, and we will expand our attacks. Hundreds of terrorists have been killed, and dozens taken captive. We have killed hundreds of terrorists near the border fence as they attempted to enter Israel and while they were traveling outside of Israel. Over 400 terrorists have been killed, and there are thousands of injured in Gaza.

In the Northern Command, there was fire directed at outposts near Mount Dov in recent hours, with no casualties on our side. The IDF responded with extensive artillery fire at the points from which the fire was launched. At this stage, there is no further threat in the Mount Dov area or the northern sector. We remain highly prepared and strongly deployed in the Northern Command with air and ground forces. Our readiness extends across all sectors, including Judea and Samaria. As I mentioned, we are focusing on all theaters of war, and our preparedness covers each one. Anyone who attacks Israel will face a heavy price.

We are monitoring all casualties, including the dead and wounded. Regarding reports on the fallen, we are first and foremost notifying the families. In this process, we have so far informed 26 families about the loss of their loved ones. We will continue to support the families during this difficult time. I want to extend my condolences to the families of the civilians and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded, both civilians and soldiers. As of today, the IDF has launched a website where the names and details of the IDF soldiers who have fallen in this war will be published, of course, only after their families have been informed. I understand the public’s desire for information. Families seeking information about soldiers who are unaccounted for can contact the IDF’s Public Inquiries Office via the following number: 1111, extension 5, and then extension 4. This will also be published on the IDF website. You can also contact the Home Front Command hotline by dialing 104 for public instructions.

For civilians searching for their loved ones, the Home Front Command and the Israel Police have opened a joint hotline. You can reach it by dialing 105. This hotline will also address the issue of missing persons and will be located in Airport City, near Ben Gurion Airport, in the building of Unit 433. There, the public can also provide DNA samples to help with identifying the missing.

To sum up, we have faced a difficult day, and more challenging hours and days lie ahead. The resilience of the residents of the Gaza envelope and all the citizens of Israel is crucial to our ability to continue fighting. Our goal in the coming day is to end the fighting, eliminate all terrorists in the Gaza envelope, secure all breaches, and evacuate the residents so we can continue the combat. We are continuing with our extensive attacks on Gaza and will exact a price in every theater of the war against anyone who attacks us.

At this time, national responsibility and unity are required from all of us. As the IDF has proven in the past, we know how to face any war, and we will do so again this time. We ask the public to act responsibly and not spread unverified details about incidents. Please stick to the information released by the IDF. Behind these images and videos are families; help us maintain their dignity by refraining from sharing these images. Hamas’s actions are war crimes. Taking women and children as hostages is against international law, against Islam, and we will hold accountable anyone involved.

The most important thing for the IDF is the resilience of the public and its trust. The war is difficult, and there are tough days ahead. The IDF is strong and will use all its power and might.
