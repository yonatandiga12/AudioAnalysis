Good afternoon,

This morning, we rescued Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Zhan Shlomi Ziv, and Andrey Kozlov, who were abducted on October 7 from the Nova party into Gaza. Just a few minutes ago, the second helicopter landed with the rescued hostages at Sheba Medical Center. They are all in good health, their medical condition is stable, and they are currently at the hospital where they will undergo medical examinations and reunite with their families.

The four were rescued in a joint operation by the IDF, the Shin Bet, and the Israeli Police. This bold daylight operation involved Shin Bet and Yamam fighters storming two separate buildings simultaneously in the heart of the Gaza Strip, rescuing the four hostages who were held by Hamas terrorists under heavy fire. During the operation, the Southern Command and Air Force attacked threats to our forces in the area. These threats were neutralized from the air, sea, and land to ensure the safe extraction of our forces, who came under fire but were rescued safely.

The Chief of Staff and the Head of the Shin Bet led the operation side by side, following weeks of planning based on high-quality intelligence and a complex operational plan developed by the Shin Bet, Yamam, Military Intelligence, the Air Force, and the Southern Command. Hundreds of fighters from Shin Bet, Yamam, Division 98, the Paratroopers Brigade, Brigade 7, the Kfir Brigade, Air Force pilots, and naval units participated in the operation. The fighters acted with professionalism and great courage. Among them was a Yamam fighter who was seriously injured during the action and has just arrived at the hospital. We wish him a full recovery and pray for his well-being.

This operation involved significant operational risks, but it successfully rescued four hostages alive and brought them home. Alongside the great joy of Noa, Andrey, Shlomi, and Almog's return, we will continue to do everything to bring back the remaining 120 hostages still held in Gaza. Know that we are determined to reach you, and the mission will not be completed until you are all home.

To all the families of the hostages, know that we are making tremendous efforts and working in every possible way to bring all the hostages home as quickly as possible. We will not leave any hostage behind. I want to say it is a great pride to see the security forces working shoulder to shoulder for the important mission of bringing back the hostages. We will continue to do everything, everything, to bring them back.
