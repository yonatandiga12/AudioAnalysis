Good evening,

A short while ago, Iran launched dozens of surface-to-surface missiles from its territory toward Israel. The vast majority of the missiles were intercepted outside Israel's borders by our air defense systems. A few missiles did land in our territory. At this point, we know of one injured child and minor damage to IDF infrastructure at a base in the south. I repeat, minor damage to IDF infrastructure at a base in the south. In addition, Air Force planes intercepted over ten cruise missiles outside the country’s borders, and dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles were also intercepted outside Israeli airspace. In total, over 200 threats were launched.

The incident is not yet over, and we continue to intercept incoming threats, including UAVs and possibly more cruise missiles. We are still fully deployed with dozens of aircraft in the air providing defense. Although most of the threats have been intercepted, I reiterate: no risks should be taken. Please follow the Home Front Command's guidelines as they save lives.

As I mentioned, the event is still ongoing, and the alert system of the Home Front Command will provide sufficient warning in areas under threat. The IDF is strongly deployed across all fronts and prepared for further developments. We were prepared for these scenarios in advance and are operating according to well-defined plans.

Please continue to adhere to the instructions and demonstrate the responsibility and calm you’ve shown throughout the recent hours. The IDF will do everything necessary to protect the security of Israeli civilians, and I will continue to update you with any operational developments.
