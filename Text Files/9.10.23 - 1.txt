Good morning, good afternoon.

I want to provide a review and update with information available up to this point in the morning, for the public, regarding last night's and this morning's events. First, I will start with the defense. From my perspective, the focus now is on the communities surrounding Gaza. We are in control of these communities. The incidents that occurred in the last hours and overnight were isolated events of single encounters.

In Sha'ar HaNegev, three terrorists were killed by a reservist unit. In Be'eri, one person was killed, and in another incident, a cell was eliminated in Holit and Sufa with five terrorists killed. In Alumim, four terrorists were killed. Currently, we are sweeping all the communities and continuing to clear the area, but we are in control of the communities. At this stage, there is no active combat in the communities. You should understand that there might still be terrorists in the area, like the terrorists we found in Sha'ar HaNegev. These terrorists hid in a position, which we neutralized, killing them. In every encounter, terrorists are met by military forces that engage and kill them.

Our soldiers, special units, and infantry brigades are fighting bravely. These are intense battles, and as I said, at the moment, there is no combat. Organizing the area is today's main task. When I say organizing the area, I mean the breaches in the Gaza border fence. These breaches will be secured by tanks that will arrive in the area, positioned by combat helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, to ensure no terrorist infiltrations into Israel.

The communities adjacent to the fence are currently being evacuated. We have fully evacuated 15 out of 24 communities, and by the end of the day, we expect to have evacuated all the communities near the fence. Sderot will not be evacuated at this stage.

Israel has been hit with 4,400 rockets. In northern Israel, we have high preparedness, with a strong defense and many ground forces deployed. Yesterday, there were several localized incidents on the border at our outposts, but none of our forces were harmed. We responded with fire to all those locations, and we are firmly holding the north. There is no combat in the north at this time, and we are fully prepared for any scenario.

Now, to the offense, which is the main focus. The IDF is on the offensive. We have initiated powerful waves of attacks, with wide-scale airstrikes. Every four hours, a wave is launched, with hundreds and thousands of munitions targeting objectives. As we speak, northern Gaza is under attack in such a wave, with hundreds of targets. In every target we hit, there are terrorists. We are not striking areas without terrorists; every intelligence report locating terrorists is hit. We are targeting all enemy assembly areas, every intelligence point, every command center, and every control room they have.

There are hundreds of Hamas terrorists dead in the Gaza envelope. We haven’t yet gathered all the bodies, but there are hundreds of Hamas terrorists killed along the border by helicopters, planes, tanks, and infantry forces. Dozens of terrorists were killed last night in the strikes in Beit Hanoun, buried under buildings.

The borders are closed in Gaza. There is no electricity, and no goods are entering. Gaza is under siege. We have launched a massive reserve call-up, the largest and fastest in Israel's history, with 300,000 reservists mobilized in 48 hours. Israel's citizens have shown their best. We are in full control, and we will maintain that control.

There have been Israeli casualties. Approximately 700 citizens and soldiers have been killed so far. We have notified the families of 73 fallen soldiers, and we stand by them during this difficult time. There are hundreds of wounded, and we wish them all a speedy recovery. There are also abducted individuals, missing soldiers, and civilians.

Hamas has published information and videos showing their brutality. We have appointed Major General Lior Carmeli to oversee the issue, with many personnel already working to update the families and collect DNA samples. We will only share information with the public after notifying the families.

This is the largest terrorist event in Israel's history. Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization, and its leadership—both military and political—along with all its assets, are legitimate IDF targets. We are attacking widely and powerfully, with a focused, intelligence-driven approach. All our forces will be deployed to bring an overwhelming response, and our power will only increase.
